# Ethical Acquisition of Art
 Examined data sets containing information about artworks and artists at MoMA and Tate Museum to develop data-driven conclusions and recommendations for museum curators regarding shortcomings in representative acquisitions

## Inspiration
Museums are a primary mode of connecting people with artâ€“they are integral to our perceptions of art, the people who create it, and our subconscious conclusions regarding what art is deemed important versus what art is not. In more recent times, the practice of ethically cataloging artist and artwork data has become a more prominent topic of discussion in museums internationally.

Our team was interested in the demographic of artists and dates of creation for works in major Euro-centrically focused museums, and the patterns that emerge. Additionally, because the nature of data analysis is to distill artwork to its raw descriptive characteristics (artist, materials, date of creation, etc.), this kind of exploration inspired our team to look at art in a way that goes beyond the visual norm. We were interested to see how we can gain a new understanding of art and museums through data-driven research, while also making interesting discoveries that could inform recommendations to museum curators and other interested parties.
